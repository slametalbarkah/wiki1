<h1>Challenger (horse)</h1>
            
            Challenger (1927–1948) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse who became a Leading sire in North America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Challenger was a bay horse bred by The National Stud at Tully in County Kildare, Ireland. As a yearling, Challenger was bought for 5,000 guineas by Lord Dewar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Racing career ==<br/><br/>At age two, Challenger made two starts, winning both the Richmond and Clearwell Stakes. Following the death of Lord Dewar, his nephew John Arthur Dewar inherited his horses and, in 1930, he sold Challenger for £10,000, the then equivalent of US$100,000, to the American racing partnership of William Brann and Robert Castle.<br/><br/>Registered in the United States as Challenger II, the expensive colt never fully recovered from an injury to his hocks and had no success on American racetracks. However, as a sire, he would prove to be more than worth the price Brann and Castle paid for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Stud record ==<br/><br/>Challenger stood at stud at his owners Branncastle Farm near Walkersville, Maryland, where he proved a very successful sire and was the leading sire in North America in 1939. His best son was Challedon, a colt born in 1936 whose major wins included the Preakness Stakes, the Pimlico Special, and the Hollywood Gold Cup. Challedon was voted American Horse of the Year in 1939 and 1940 and, following its formation, was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.
