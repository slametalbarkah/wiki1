            Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 2nd Baron Upper Ossory (c. 1535 – 11 September 1581) was an Irish military officer and politician. He was educated at the court of Henry VIII of England with Edward, Prince of Wales. While he was in France, he corresponded regularly with King Edward VI. He was active in suppressing Wyatt's rebellion in 1553. He went home to Ireland, where he would have a lifelong feud with the Earl of Ormonde. His wife and daughter were abducted in 1573 by the Grace family, supposedly at Ormonde's instigation. He killed his cousin, the rebel Rory O'More in 1578.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Fitzpatrick was the eldest son and heir of Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 1st Baron Upper Ossory and Margaret, eldest daughter of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond. He was born in Ireland, probably about 1535. Sent at an early age into England as a pledge of his father's loyalty, he was educated at court, where he became the closest companion of Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VI, with whom he was to remain on close terms until the death of the latter. He was among the chief mourners at the funeral of King Henry VIII, the father of Edward.
