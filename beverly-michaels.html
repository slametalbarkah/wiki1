            Beverly Eileen Michaels (December 29, 1927 – June 9, 2007) was an American B-movie actress and cheesecake model of the 1950s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Michaels began her career at the age of 16 in 1944 as a showgirl at Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe Nightclub in New York. Her stage debut, also at age 16, was in the play Glad to See You which ran in Philadelphia and Boston from November 1944 to January 1945. After that show closed, she was a dancer in Havana for about a year. Returning to the US, she worked as a chorus girl on Broadway.<br/><br/>Arriving in Hollywood in 1948 at the age of 21 and standing at least 5 feet 9 inches tall (some sources cited 6 feet), Michaels quickly found modeling jobs, in which she was initially credited as "Beverley Michaels." Under contract to MGM Studios, she made her first screen appearance in Mervyn LeRoy's East Side, West Side (February 1950), starring Barbara Stanwyck, Ava Gardner, James Mason and Van Heflin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Michaels then appeared in two films by independent film director and producer Hugo Haas. The first, the 1951 film noir Pickup, was a surprise hit, albeit a secondary B feature, and launched Haas's career as a Hollywood director. It also had a large part in starting the cycle of bad girl movies of the 1950s, which usually starred blonde sexpots. The New York Times' film reviewer wrote:  "Beverly Michaels, a comparative newcomer, is flashily attractive, hard and vulgar as his two-timing mate, but her histrionics are, like the cheap character she portrays, coarse and in need of polishing." Haas' follow-up release The Girl on the Bridge (1951) was his last picture with Michaels.
