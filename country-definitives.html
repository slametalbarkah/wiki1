            Country definitives, previously known as regionals, are the postage stamps issued for each of the home nations of the United Kingdom and (until 1969) the Channel Islands and (until 1973) the Isle of Man.<br/><br/>Postage stamps were first issued in May 1840 and were valid throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until 1922 and in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thereafter.<br/><br/>In 1958, specific stamps were issued for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man. The designs used the same portrait as the Wilding series of stamps, but were specially designed to incorporate the symbols of each of the home nations and Crown dependencies.<br/><br/>Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Isle of Man "regional" stamps were replaced on decimalisation with new designs in the Machin series, having the relevant emblem shown in the top left-hand corner.  They were replaced between 1999 and 2000 with new designs for the four home nations.<br/><br/>While generally sold at post offices in their respective areas, all were valid throughout the UK and, until they became postally independent, the Crown Dependencies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Post-war proposal ==<br/><br/>The idea of regional stamps came up after World War II to help tourism in the Channel Islands, which had been occupied by German forces until the end of the conflict. The concept was extended to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and essays were prepared: positions of King George VI's head and symbols.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 1958 issues ==<br/><br/>Special committees were established to choose the heraldic emblems or symbols for the each country or island.
