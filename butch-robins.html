            Joseph Calvin "Butch" Robins (born May 12, 1949, in Lebanon, Russell County, Virginia) is an American five-string–banjo player with his own, distinct style. He's an individualist and, according to himself, "a seeker of information, knowledge and wisdom."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Few banjo players are as innovative or stylistically diverse as is "Butch" Robins. He was one of the longest-tenured banjoists for Bill Monroe and The Blue Grass Boys, and bassist for the New Grass Revival, earning him the distinction of being "the one and only New Grass/Blue Grass Boy."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/>As a student of music and the banjo in the 1960s and '70s, Robins acquainted himself with and befriended many of the first generation bluegrass musicians at early festivals and fiddlers' conventions.<br/><br/>As a teenager, he won major banjo contests and participated in banjo workshops at the 1969 Newport Folk Festival and at Carlton Haney's 1969 Camp Springs Bluegrass Festival, in Reidsville, North Carolina.<br/><br/>While serving in the United States Army in South Carolina, Robins was introduced to Snuffy Jenkins &amp; Pappy Sherrill. He later dedicated his first solo album, Forty Years Late, to Snuffy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1970s group and solo ===<br/><br/>In the 1970s, Robins performed in a number of bands, including Charlie Moore, Jim &amp; Jesse, Wilma Lee &amp; Stoney Cooper, and the New Grass Revival. During these years, he explored various banjo techniques, and helped lay the groundwork for the progressive, melodic, five-string banjo playing of today. As a self-produced solo recording artist with interest in and attention to ensemble sound, Robins released three landmark albums with Rounder Records: Forty Years Late, Fragments of My Imagination, and The Fifth Child.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys ===<br/><br/>From 1977 until 1981, Robins played banjo for Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys, performing throughout the United States, including the White House and Lincoln Center in New York City.
