            Charles James Jolliffe (1861–1943) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Everton.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Charles Jolliffe was a tall, lean footballer for Everton in the pre-Football League era. He was the number one choice as goalkeeper between October 1885 and October 1887. He lost his place to Robert Smalley as the Football League era dawned.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== League Debut ==<br/><br/>Robert Smalley was Everton's regular goalkeeper in 1888–89. However, in match seven, the trip to County Ground, Derby Robert Smalley was injured so Jolliffe got the chance to make his Football League debut. The opponents were Derby County and the date was 20 October 1888. Derby County were described as a "poor side" by the commentators of that time and James Costley soon put Everton ahead. He then scored his second to give Everton a comfortable lead. As the half wore on Derby County improved and Jolliffe conceded his first League goal to William Chatterton.
