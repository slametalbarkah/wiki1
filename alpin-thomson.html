<h1>Alpin Thomson</h1>
            
            Alpin Erroll Thomson  (14 May 1893 – 6 March 1960) played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club and the Royal Navy Cricket Club in 1922 and 1923. He also played international rugby union for Scotland. He was born in Perth, Western Australia and died at Hawridge, Chesham, Buckinghamshire. In some sources, his second name is spelled "Errol".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Family and background ==<br/><br/>Thomson's father, also called Alpin Thomson, was a colonial administrator in Western Australia at the time of his birth, being under-secretary for railways in the colony's government. His mother was, in one account, the daughter of the colonial secretary (equivalent to chief minister) of Western Australia from 1877 to 1880, Sir Roger Goldsworthy, and Goldsworthy left Alpin Thomson Sr and his wife with his unfinished house, called Lucknow, at Claremont, when he was posted to St Lucia in 1881. In 1933, Thomson's mother was cited in The Times as one of just nine remaining survivors of the Siege of Lucknow in 1857; if that is accurate, it explains the name of the house, but she is likely on grounds of age to have been Goldsworthy's step-daughter rather than a direct descendant. By the time of the First World War, Thomson's parents had retired to live at Wellington, Somerset.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Naval career ==<br/><br/>At the age of 13 in 1906, Thomson was sent to the Osborne Naval College on the Isle of Wight. He then moved on to the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, Devon, where he won an award for swimming.
