            Christian Matthew (born October 26, 1996) is an American professional football cornerback for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Georgia Southern before transferring to Samford, and then to Valdosta State, where he was tied for fifth in the nation in pass break ups and was named first-team All-Gulf South Conference. Matthew was invited to and participated in the 2022 College Gridirion Showcase post-season all-star event.<br/><br/>As a senior at Chattahoochee High School, Matthew had 29 catches for 629 yards at wide receiver and 64 tackles and four interceptions on defense on his way to being named second-team all-state and First-team All-Bi-City. He enrolled at Georgia Southern after his senior year before transferring to Samford, citing the lack of a transfer portal influencing his decision to go to an FCS school rather than sit out a year.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Professional career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Matthew was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the seventh round (244th overall) of the 2022 NFL draft. He was released on October 2, 2023.<br/><br/>On October 3, 2023, Matthew was signed to the practice squad of the Chicago Bears. He was not signed to a reserve/future contract after the season and thus became a free agent.<br/><br/>On January 16, 2024, Matthew was signed to the practice squad of the Baltimore Ravens.
