<h1>Christopher Cottle</h1>
            
            Christopher Clarke Cottle (born May 18, 1940) is an American lawyer and jurist, who served as the Presiding Justice of the California Sixth District Court of Appeal from 1993 to 2001, Associate Justice of that court from 1988 to 1993, and District Attorney of Santa Cruz County from 1975 to 1977.  Cottle holds the unusual status of having been appointed to judgeships by both Democratic and Republican governors.  He is also a former captain of the Stanford University football team.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education and football ==<br/><br/>Born in Los Angeles, Cottle grew up in nearby Inglewood, where he attended Andrew Bennett Elementary School and Morningside High School.  After Cottle was placed in foster care at the age of 14, his foster parents encouraged his athleticism, and he became a three-sport athlete at Morningside, playing on the school's baseball, basketball, and football teams.  He was also student body president and served as the president of the California Association of Student Body Presidents.<br/><br/>Cottle entered the University of California, Berkeley in 1958, but after attending for one day, he realized the school was a poor fit and transferred to Stanford University in time to start the fall quarter, as Fall Semester at Berkeley started one month before Fall Quarter at Stanford.  After his transfer was approved but before classes began, he worked for the construction company building Stanford Hospital.  Awarded a football scholarship, Cottle was a linebacker and center.  A three-year letterman, he eventually became captain of the Stanford football team that defeated Cottle's former school (Cal) in the 1961 Big Game.
