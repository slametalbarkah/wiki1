            Veijeany Christopher Samba (born 28 March 1984), known as Christopher Samba, is a former professional footballer who played as a defender. Born in France, he played for the Congo national team.<br/><br/>Samba notably played in the Premier League for Blackburn Rovers where he played for five years, notching up 161 league appearances with 16 goals. He also played top flight football in England for Queens Park Rangers with a spell in the EFL Championship with Aston Villa. He also played for Sedan, Hertha BSC, Anzhi Makhachkala, Dynamo Moscow and Panathinaikos.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early career ===<br/><br/>Born in the Parisian suburb of Créteil, Samba began his career with French Ligue 2 club Sedan, having previously played for D’Issy-les-Moulineaux and Rouen. As a result, he left Créteil in his youth to move to Sedan. At one point, Samba played in a striker position before switching to a centre–back position. After progressing through the ranks of the Sedan's Academy, he made his debut for the club in the opening game of the season against FC Istres, starting a match before being sent–off in the 57th minute, in a 2–0 loss. However, after making two more appearances for the side, Samba suffered an adductors injury that kept him out for the rest of the 2003–04 season.
