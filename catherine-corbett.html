            Catherine Isobel Ida Corbett (née Vans Agnew; 1869–1950) was a British suffragette, one of those imprisoned  and awarded the Hunger Strike Medal, for the cause of the Women's Social and Political Union.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Catherine Corbett was born Catherine Isobel Ida Vans Agnew in 1869 to George Vans Agnew from Wigtownshire, Scotland and Rosa Coppard Wilson. She had four brothers and one sister. In the family, at least, she was always known as Ida.<br/><br/>She married Frank Corbett on 22 October 1895 and was widowed in 1912.<br/><br/>Corbett was described as "a tall, dark and handsome lady".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Suffrage activism ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>She became active in the  WSPU and she was arrested for obstruction and she and Olive Fargus were photographed in the Daily Mirror with a suffragette deputation on 24 February 1908, and then imprisoned for four weeks. She was also called 'an aristocrat supporter of the suffragette movement' in the Los Angeles Herald 25 February 1909.<br/><br/>Corbett was one of those seen pestering the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith at 10 Downing Street to receive their women's suffrage group to discuss legislation and she then informed the waiting press that the Prime Minister had said 'I think you are very silly".<br/><br/>The Museum of London has a photograph of these women walking along with the Prime Minister in Downing Street.
