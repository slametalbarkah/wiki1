In 1992 he became artistic director of the Basel Chamber Symphony, and he founded the Camerata de Sa Nostra in Palma de Mallorca in 1994. From 1997 he was Principal 2nd Violinist in the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado.<br/><br/>Although always very interested in many different styles of music, jazz was his biggest passion and he began learning to play the trumpet and playing jazz. In 1999 he founded The Berlin Philharmonic Jazz Group. With this group he played -and still does- as a soloist on the trumpet and the violin in Europe and the Far East. He is also a member of the Absolute Ensemble New York City (leader Kristjan Järvi) and 1st Violin of the Aura Quartett Basel, which toured Indonesia in 2011.
