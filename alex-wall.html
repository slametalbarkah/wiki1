            Alexander David Wall (born 22 September 1990) is an English semi-professional footballer who plays as a striker for  St Albans City.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Thatcham Town ===<br/><br/>Born in Thatcham, Berkshire, Wall began his career at hometown club Thatcham Town. He was part of the club's under-18 team that won the 2007–08 Football Conference Youth Alliance championship, beating Ebbsfleet United under-18's 4–2 in the final.<br/><br/>He worked his way into the club's first-team at the age of 18, entering play as a substitute and scoring on his debut in a 6–1 win over Andover on 11 April 2009.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Maidenhead United ===<br/><br/>Wall's progress through Thatcham's youth team was noticed by nearby Conference South side Maidenhead United, who signed him in the summer of 2009. In his first season at the club, Wall was primarily used as an impact substitute, and he scored an injury-time winner in Maidenhead's 3–2 victory over local rivals Basingstoke Town on 14 November 2009 after coming off the bench. In total, Wall scored 10 goals in 41 appearances in all competitions during the 2009–10 season, with seven of these goals coming from appearances off the bench.<br/><br/>Wall played fewer games in the 2010–11 season, scoring only three league goals, but his performances led to interest from Football League clubs. In July 2011, he went on trial with League One side Notts County, though a proposed transfer fell through despite a fee having been agreed between the two clubs. Maidenhead manager Johnson Hippolyte admitted Wall was "devastated" that Notts County pulled out of the deal.
