            Adam Kingsley (born 20 August 1975) is a former Australian rules footballer and current senior coach of the Greater Western Sydney Giants in the Australian Football League (AFL). Kingsley was a premiership player for Port Adelaide, before spending time as an assistant coach at St Kilda and Richmond.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Port Adelaide ===<br/><br/>Originally from Eastern Ranges, he was playing for the Essendon Football Club's reserves team, before being recruited by Port Adelaide. Debuting in the Port Adelaide Football Club's inaugural 1997 AFL side, Kingsley was known as a consistent defender/midfielder.		<br/><br/>He struggled in 2003, coming close to being delisted, but improved his form and cemented a spot during 2004, being a premiership player that year after working his way back into the side.		<br/><br/>2005 saw another consistent season from Kingsley, however, he played just five games in 2006, which cast doubts over his career. In his fifth game in Round 22, he injured his anterior cruciate ligament, which forced his retirement. He said in The Age on 12 September 2006, that he had hoped to continue playing in 2007 before the injury.		<br/><br/>Kingsley played a total of 170 games and kicked a total of 47 goals for Port Adelaide from 1997 until 2006, and was a member of the Port Adelaide premiership side in 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Coaching career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Assistant coaching (2007–2022) ===<br/><br/>In 2007, Kingsley became an assistant coach at Port Adelaide, a position in which he stayed in until the end of 2010. He then joined St Kilda at the end of the 2010 season as an assistant coach, staying at the club until 2018 before joining Richmond as an assistant coach in 2019.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Greater Western Sydney senior coach (2023–present) ===<br/><br/>Kingsley was appointed senior coach of Greater Western Sydney on 22 August 2022. Kingsley replaced GWS caretaker senior coach Mark McVeigh, who coached the Giants after Leon Cameron stepped down in the middle of the 2022 season.
