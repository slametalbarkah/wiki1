            Bad Frequencies is the sixth studio album by American post-hardcore band Hawthorne Heights. The album was released on April 27, 2018 through Pure Noise Records.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background and production ==<br/><br/>Vocalist/guitarist JT Woodruff stated that the album was written over the course of a year in 2017 while the band was touring, saying "We played 170 shows in 2017, wrote every moment that we could, then demoed, then recorded an album. I think we fit everything we possibly could in 365 days, and we are very proud of that."<br/><br/>On May 31, 2017, the band released a 30-second music video teaser for the song "Push Me Away" via their Facebook page. A digital single for the song was released the same day. The full music video for "Push Me Away" debuted on June 5 via Dying Scene. The band stated that the song would appear on a new studio album, which at the time was untitled. Bad Frequencies was recorded at Capitol House Studios, and produced by the band and Mark Ingram, who also acted as engineer. Cameron Webb mixed the recordings, before they were mastered by Andrew Alekel. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Release ==<br/><br/>The second advance single from the album, "Pink Hearts," was released on March 1, 2018.
