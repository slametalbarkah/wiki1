            Sir Cecil Harold Hoskins (1889–1971) was an Australian industrialist associated with the iron and steel industry. He is notable mainly for the establishment of the steel industry at Port Kembla, the company Australian Iron &amp; Steel, and its subsequent merger with BHP in 1935. He was also on the board of the Australian Mutual Provident Society for many years and was its chairman from 1947 to 1962. He is less well known for his involvement in centre-right political organisations and the scouting movement, and his interest in landscape gardens.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Cecil Hoskins was the fourth-eldest child of Charles Hoskins and his wife Emily. He was born in Petersham, New South Wales, on 11 November 1889. He was one of their eight children who would survive their early childhood, and the second-eldest son.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By the time of his birth, his father was on the verge of becoming  a prosperous manufacturer, being a half owner, with his elder brother George, of the company G &amp; C Hoskins. In only a few years, the company expanded rapidly as a manufacturer of cast iron and steel pipes.  Hoskins had a privileged upbringing, as the son of a wealthy industrialist.
