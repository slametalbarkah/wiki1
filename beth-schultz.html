She has campaigned for the preservation of the Karri forests in the south-west of Western Australia since 1975.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Schultz was born in Roma, Queensland in 1936. She completed her education at boarding school, where she was head prefect. Her first degree was a BA in romance languages. She holds a further four degrees, including an LLB which she took "because she thought the environment movement needed a lawyer".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Schultz began lobbying to protect Karri forests in the south-west of Western Australia in 1975 from woodchipping. At that time she was instrumental in the launch of the South West Forests Defence Foundation, while in the 1980s she worked to protect the Shannon National Park and in the 1990s was a significant contributor to the WA Forest Alliance. She served as president of the Conservation Council of Western Australia for three years.<br/><br/>Schultz was interviewed in 1994 by Gregg Borschmann for the people's forest oral history project.
