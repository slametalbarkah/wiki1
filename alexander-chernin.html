            Alexander Mikhailovich Chernin (Russian: Александр Михайлович Чернин; born 6 March 1960) is a Soviet-born Hungarian chess grandmaster and trainer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Tournaments and championships ==<br/><br/>Born in Kharkiv, Ukrainian SSR, as a youth he frequently succeeded in tournaments and climbed rapidly through the junior rankings to participate at the very highest level. At Skien in 1979, he entered the World Junior Championship and finished runner-up to Yasser Seirawan. A short while later (January 1980), he played in the European Junior Championship at Groningen and won the event (ahead of Zurab Azmaiparashvili).<br/><br/>These prestigious successes soon led him to an International Master title and more importantly, laid the foundation stones for his continued development over the next few years. There were many tournament victories, either outright or shared, including Irkutsk 1980, Copenhagen 1984 (and 1986 with Vasily Smyslov), Stary Smokovec 1984, Polanica Zdroj (Rubinstein Memorial) 1988 (with Alexander Goldin), Prague 1989 and Marseilles 1990 (with Evgeny Bareev). Also of note were the shared second places achieved at Cienfuegos (Capablanca Memorial) 1981 and Reggio Emilia 1986/7.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of his playing career undoubtedly occurred in 1985, when he became a Grandmaster, won the Soviet Championship (jointly with Viktor Gavrikov and Mikhail Gurevich) and scored well in the Gammarth (Tunisia) Interzonal for a place in the Montpellier Candidates Tournament. Unfortunately, his World Championship Candidacy went no further, as he could only manage a mid-table finish. He was however a double gold medal winner in the same year, taking team and individual honours at the inaugural World Team Championship, held in Luzern, where he represented the USSR.<br/><br/>At another first time event, the World Blitz Championship held in Saint John 1988, he finished joint third (with Kiril Georgiev, after Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian).
