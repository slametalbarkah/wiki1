            The armoured bulldozer is a basic tool of combat engineering. These combat engineering vehicles combine the earth moving capabilities of the bulldozer with armour which protects the vehicle and its operator in or near combat. Most are civilian bulldozers modified by addition of vehicle armour/military equipment, but some are tanks stripped of armament and fitted with a dozer blade. Some tanks (called tankdozers) have bulldozer blades while retaining their armament, but this does not make them armoured bulldozers as such, because combat remains the primary role—earth moving is a secondary task.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== World War II ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first armoured bulldozer (D7A) was developed by the British during World War II. This was a conventional Caterpillar D7 bulldozer fitted with armour to protect the driver and the engine. The work was carried out by Jack Olding &amp; Company Ltd of Hatfield. The bulldozer was one of several specialist armored vehicles that were collectively referred to as "Hobart's Funnies" and were operated by the British 79th Armoured Division in support of armoured assaults.<br/><br/>The bulldozers were produced in preparation for the Battle of Normandy with the tasks of clearing the invasion beaches of obstacles and quickly making roads accessible by clearing rubble and filling in bomb craters.<br/><br/>As Allied armies advanced through Europe, the armoured bulldozer was found to be too slow—there was a need for well-armoured, obstacle clearing vehicle that was fast enough to keep up with tank formations. This need was met by the Centaur Bulldozer—a Centaur tank with the turret removed and a bulldozer blade fitted.
