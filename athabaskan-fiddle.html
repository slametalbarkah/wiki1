            Athabaskan fiddle (or fiddle music, fiddling) is the old-time fiddle style that the Alaskan Athabaskans of the Interior Alaska have developed to play the fiddle (violin), solo and in folk ensembles. Fiddles were introduced in this area by Scottish, Irish, French Canadian, and Métis fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company in the mid-19th century. Athabaskan fiddling is a variant of fiddling of the American southlands. Athabaskan fiddle music is most popular genre in Alaska and northwest Canada and featuring Gwich'in Bill Stevens (b. 1933, he is an Athabaskan fiddling legend and recipient the Alaska Governor's 2002 Award for the Native Arts) and Trimble Gilbert (b. 1934, also Traditional Chief of Arctic Village).<br/><br/>The authoritative study of Alaskan Athabaskan fiddle music is The Crooked Stovepipe: Athapaskan Fiddle Music and Square Dancing in Northeast Alaska and Northwest Canada (1993), by Athabaskanist and ethnomusicologist Craig Mishler (now an independent scholar and formerly affiliate research professor at the Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/>In a sense, there are two main beginnings of Alaskan old-time music: the original introduction of fiddle music in 1847, and Alaska's version of the great folk music revival in the 1970s.<br/><br/>In addition to the fiddle music repertoire, which is distinctively Athabaskan fiddlers incorporate country music into their performances, leaving blurred lines of distinction between Athabaskan fiddle music and country music. Athabaskan fiddle music has been cultivated in relative isolation from mainstream American country music.
