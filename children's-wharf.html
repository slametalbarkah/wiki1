            Children's Wharf (until recently known as Museum Wharf) is a wharf on Congress Street in Boston, Massachusetts, on the Fort Point Channel with views of the Financial District and Boston Harbor. The wharf has sitting areas, patches of lawn, and several tourist attractions.<br/><br/>By way of the Congress Street Bridge, Children's Wharf is a short walk from South Station, one of Boston's principal transportation hubs. The wharf is one of the more easily accessible locations on the Harborwalk, a newly established walking tour akin to the Freedom Trail, intended to take advantage of the change in landscape brought about by the Big Dig.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Boston Children's Museum ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wharf takes its name from Boston Children's Museum (founded in 1913), which moved here from Jamaica Plain in 1979.<br/><br/>The museum is housed in a former industrial building expanded and renovated by Cambridge Seven Associates to take full advantage of the dramatic waterfront site.<br/><br/>In 2007 the museum completed a $47 million renovation and 23,000-square-foot (2,100 m2) expansion. The improvements include green features such as green roofs, storm water reclamation to reduce run-off into Fort Point Channel, and building materials that are recycled, local, and low-emitting to qualify the Museum for the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification.<br/><br/>Au Bon Pain is located on the ground floor of the museum in a space formerly occupied by McDonald's.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Hood Milk Bottle ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>At 40 feet (12 m) tall and 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter, the structure now known as the Hood Milk Bottle was originally constructed in 1933 on the banks of the Three Mile River in Taunton, Massachusetts.
