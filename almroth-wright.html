            Sir Almroth Edward Wright  (10 August 1861 – 30 April 1947) was an English bacteriologist and immunologist.<br/><br/>He is notable for developing a system of anti-typhoid fever inoculation, recognizing early on that antibiotics would create resistant bacteria, and being a strong advocate for preventive medicine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Wright was born at Middleton Tyas, near Richmond, North Yorkshire into a family of mixed Anglo-Irish and Swedish descent. He was the son of Reverend Charles Henry Hamilton Wright, deacon of Middleton Tyas, who later served in Belfast, Dublin, and Liverpool and managed the Protestant Reformation Society. His mother, Ebba Almroth, was the daughter of Nils Wilhelm Almroth, Governor of the Swedish Royal Mint in Stockholm. His younger brother Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright became the librarian of the London Library.<br/><br/>In 1882, he graduated from Trinity College Dublin with first-class honours in modern literature and won a gold medal in modern languages and literature.: 2  Simultaneously he took medicine courses and in 1883 graduated in medicine.: 3  In the late 19th century, Wright worked with the armed forces of Britain to develop vaccines and promote immunisation.<br/><br/>He married Jane Georgina Wilson (1861-1926) in 1889 and had three children. The first, Edward Robert Mackay Wright (1890–1913), was born in Glebe, Sydney. Second son Leonard Almoth Wilson Wright (1891–1972) was born in Dublin, as was daughter Doris Helena MacNaughton Wright (later Romanes, after whom the Helena Romanes School was named) (1894–1990).
