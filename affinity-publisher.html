            Affinity Publisher is a desktop publishing application developed by Serif for iPadOS, macOS and Microsoft Windows. It is a part of the Affinity product line along with Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>Affinity Publisher serves as a successor to Serif's own PagePlus software, which the company discontinued in August 2017 to focus on the Affinity product range. It has been described as an alternative to Adobe InDesign, due to its primary focus on desktop publishing workflows for both printed and online media, including common features from this industry, such as master pages, OpenType support, linked text frames, and end-to-end support for the CMYK color model.<br/><br/>Affinity Publisher includes StudioLink technology, developed by Serif, which allows owners of Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo to use the vector and raster graphic editing functionality of those applications for editing content directly within Publisher (in addition to its own, smaller set of native vector and raster editing features).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== File format support ===<br/><br/>File formats supported by Affinity Publisher (in addition to the Affinity suite's native file format) include Adobe InDesign Markup Language (only import of IDML files into Publisher, no export of IDML), Adobe Photoshop PSD, PDF, JPG, TIFF, PNG, and EPS, with export functionality for the PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4 standards of the PDF/X file format.<br/><br/>The iPadOS editions of Affinity Photo and Designer also include support for Affinity Publisher files.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Development ==<br/><br/>The first promotional video for Affinity Publisher was shown by Serif in December 2017, demonstrating features such as the drag &amp; drop functionality, and text flow between frames. A free public beta of the software was made available for both macOS and Windows on August 30, 2018.<br/><br/>The first full version of Publisher (using the 1.7 version number, to align with other Affinity products) was first released on June 19, 2019, in conjunction with Serif's 2019 'Affinity Live' event, during which the company also announced the StudioLink integration features for the first time.
