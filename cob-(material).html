            Cob, cobb, or clom (in Wales) is a natural building material made from subsoil, water, fibrous organic material (typically straw), and sometimes lime. The contents of subsoil vary, and if it does not contain the right mixture, it can be modified with sand or clay. Cob is fireproof, termite proof, resistant to seismic activity, and uses low-cost materials, although it is very labour intensive. It can be used to create artistic and sculptural forms, and its use has been revived in recent years by the natural building and sustainability movements.<br/><br/>In technical building and engineering documents, such as the Uniform Building Code of the western USA, cob may be referred to as "unburned clay masonry," when used in a structural context. It may also be referred to as "aggregate" in non-structural contexts, such as "clay and sand aggregate," or more simply "organic aggregate," such as where cob is a filler between post and beam construction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History and usage ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cob is an English term attested to around the year 1600 for an ancient building material that has been used for building since prehistoric times. The use of this material in Iran is more than 4000 years old. The etymology of cob and cobbing is unclear, but in several senses means to beat or strike, which is how cob material is applied to a wall.<br/><br/>Many similar materials and methods of earthen building are used around the world, such as adobe, lump clay, puddled clay, chalk mud, wychert, clay daubins, swish (Asante Twi), torchis (French), bauge (French), bousille (French mud with moss), beaten clay-pahsa (Central Asia), and cat and clay.
