            Anton Robert "Bob" Yellin (born June 10, 1936) is an American banjo player and founding member of The Greenbriar Boys bluegrass music group.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Yellin was born and raised in New York City. His father was an NBC studio pianist, his mother was a concert pianist, and his brother Pete Yellin was a jazz saxophonist. After studying violin, voice, and piano as a child, Bob entered the High School of Music and Art in New York, majoring in trumpet.  Following high school, he attended the City College of New York, where he majored in physics.<br/><br/>Yellin's interest in bluegrass music in general and the banjo in particular was sparked in 1954 when he heard a recording by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. After receiving an inexpensive banjo from a girlfriend, Yellin learned the basics of Scruggs style picking from Pete Seeger's book How to Play the Five-String Banjo. This was supplemented by his exposure, in the weekly folk music gatherings in Greenwich Village's Washington Square Park, to the playing of other young banjoists such as Eric Weissberg and Roger Sprung.<br/><br/>It was also in Washington Square that Yellin met guitarist/vocalist John Herald, and in 1958 Yellin, Herald, and Weissberg formed The Greenbriar Boys.  From their inception, Yellin and Herald were joined on mandolin by baritone Ralph Rinzler, until Rinzler was replaced by Frank Wakefield on their final album, “Better Late than Never.” Yellin remained with the group through the mid-1960s.
