            Christopher Alexander Warner is a fictional character on the New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street who has been portrayed by Michael Galvin since the show's first episode. Other than a 4-year gap as a result of Galvin's resignation in 1996, Chris has appeared near-continuously making him the longest running character on the show. <br/><br/>Affectionately referred to by fans and in the media as "Dr Love", Chris has been characterised by his romance storylines and respected medical career that spanned from being a junior doctor, to managing the hospital. The character has been married five times and participated in over 20 romances as well as fathering six children. He was the first member of the Warner family to join the show and in the early years of Shortland Street he appeared alongside half brother Guy Warner (Craig Parker). In later years, Chris became the patriarch of a family unit made up of his sons Harry (Reid Walker) and Phoenix (Geordie Holibar). Chris has been involved in several high profile and highly rated story lines; including a 1994 car crash, resulting drug addiction, nearly getting murdered by his brother in law Dominic Thompson (Shane Cortese), losing his wife to his drug-addicted brother Guy, ending up in jail after being framed for murder, surviving cancer and a heart attack, and a controversial abortion storyline.<br/><br/>The character of Chris is constantly noted as a backbone and "key character" of Shortland Street and his storylines have been well received. Galvin has also been praised for his portrayal of Chris.  He was nominated for "Best Actor" at the Qantas TV and Film Awards 2008.
