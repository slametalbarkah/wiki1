            Bruce Wong (born Tung Soon Wong) was a Chinese American character actor, filmmaker, and restaurateur who worked in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Bruce was born in Los Angeles as Tung Soon Wong to parents who had immigrated to Southern California from China. One of his brothers, Beal Wong, also became an actor.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Behind the camera ===<br/><br/>In 1936, after raising money in San Francisco, he made a nine-reel film—Sum Hun (a.k.a. Heartaches)—for the Chinese market, sensing a real opportunity. The Cantonese-language film starred Wai Kim, and was filmed in California under Wong's Cathay Pictures production company during an eight-day shoot. Wong served as producer, and the film was directed by Frank Tang.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Acting roles ===<br/><br/>Plans to make subsequent films never came to fruition, and he turned to acting instead. He appeared in a long list of films between 1937 and 1950, mostly in background roles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Personal ===<br/><br/>Wong was married to Genevieve; the pair had several children together.
