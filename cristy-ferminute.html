Fermin and Romel Chika currently serve as the hosts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cristy Per Minute on ABS-CBN ==<br/><br/>Cristy Fermin was one of the hosts of the top-rating Sunday talk show Showbiz Lingo (later reformatted as Showbiz Lingo Plus). When ABS-CBN executives saw her expertise in exploiting the latest showbiz news, they decided to put up a daily afternoon show that the masses would also look forward to aside from Showbiz Lingo. Cristy Per Minute was conceptualized by ABS-CBN and aired its first episode on January 30, 1995. In here, Cristy interviewed famous showbiz personalities about various issues, dished out her own opinions and even letting the viewers have their own view about the intrigues and headlines. Every Friday, the show also had its Grand Fans Day to honor and recognize celebrities and/or media personalities who gained popularity and at the peak of their careers.<br/><br/>The show was co-hosted by Ogie Diaz and John Lapus, who were working with Fermin in the top-rated Sunday talk show Showbiz Lingo. Their job on the show is to guide the viewers about the latest topics through voting and texting, wherein they have to answer a poll question and through their own segments.
