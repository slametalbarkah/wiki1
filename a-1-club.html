            The 1% Club is a British game show that has aired on ITV1 since 9 April 2022, and is hosted by Lee Mack. The show is styled as an IQ test and the questions are not based on general knowledge, like many shows, but on "logic and common sense". The top prize achievable is £100,000.<br/><br/>The first series averaged 4.39 million viewers across its span of eight episodes, whilst the second series averaged 4.51 million viewers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Gameplay ==<br/><br/>All questions used during the game are taken from a set that have been put to members of the general public prior to the show. The questions are classified by the percentage of participants who answered correctly; those with lower percentages are considered to be more difficult.<br/><br/>One hundred contestants are each given a £1,000 stake at the beginning of the game. The host asks 15 questions of increasing difficulty (90% to 1%), each of which has a 30-second time limit, and the contestants secretly lock in their answers on their mobile phones or tablets. If a contestant misses a question, they are eliminated with their stake added to the final prize pot.<br/><br/>Upon reaching the fifth question (50%), each remaining contestant is given the option to pass on any one question except the last (1%).
