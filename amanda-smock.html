            Amanda Smock (née Thieschafer, born July 27, 1982) is an American triple jumper who competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics.  In college, she was a three-time NCAA Division II track and field champion. She won the triple jump events at the United States Outdoor Championships in 2011 and 2012, and at the Indoor Championships in 2011.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Smock was born Amanda Thieschafer on July 27, 1982, to parents Beth and Glen Thieschafer. She grew up in a small town in rural Minnesota - Melrose, Minnesota, where she began competing in gymnastics at age 4.  "There was this movie called Nadia after Nadia Comăneci, and I must have watched that thing 1,000 times," Smock later remarked. "I definitely was going to be an Olympic gymnast." Although her father was a gymnastics coach, eventually she realized she was better suited for track and field, giving up on gymnastics as a teenager.  In high school, she excelled at long jump, pole vault, triple jump, and sprinting events.  Smock graduated from Melrose High School in 2000.  She attended North Dakota State University for college on an athletic scholarship, graduating in 2004.
