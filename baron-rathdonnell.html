            Baron Rathdonnell, of Rathdonnell in the County of Donegal, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

The barony is named after the townland of Rathdonnell, near the village of Trentagh, just north-west of Letterkenny.<br/><br/>The barony of Rathdonnell was the second-last barony created in the Peerage of Ireland.

As of 2025 the title is held by the sixth Baron, the second Baron's great-great-grandson, who succeeded his father in that year.<br/><br/>The Arctic explorer, Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock, was the nephew of the first Baron.<br/><br/>The family seat is Lisnavagh House, near Rathvilly, County Carlow.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Barons Rathdonnell (1868) ==<br/><br/>John McClintock, 1st Baron Rathdonnell (1798–1879)<br/><br/>Thomas Kane McClintock-Bunbury, 2nd Baron Rathdonnell (1848–1929)<br/><br/>Thomas Leopold McClintock-Bunbury, 3rd Baron Rathdonnell (1881–1937)<br/><br/>William Robert McClintock-Bunbury, 4th Baron Rathdonnell (1914–1959)<br/><br/>Thomas Benjamin McClintock-Bunbury, 5th Baron Rathdonnell (1938–2025)<br/><br/>William Leopold McClintock-Bunbury, 6th Baron Rathdonnell (born 1966)<br/><br/>The heir apparent is the present holder's son, the Hon.
