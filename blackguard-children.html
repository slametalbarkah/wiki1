            The Blackguard Children, sometimes also referred to as the Blackguard Youth, were known as gangs of mostly homeless orphans and runaways who, during the 17th and 18th centuries, dwelled in London's poorest neighbourhoods (such as Glass House Yard, Rosemary Lane, and Salt Petre Bank) and made a living by begging and pilfering. Daniel Defoe's Colonel Jack and Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist are the most prominent examples of novels dealing with such reality.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Etymology ===<br/><br/>Etymologically speaking, the word "blackguard" seems to have undergone a change between the 16th and the 18th centuries. Originally spelled as two different words, "black" plus "guard", it was eventually used as a single word to indicate those attendants or servants who were in charge of the kitchens, or perhaps black-liveried personal guards. The offensive meaning of "scoundrel", "villain", or any other term which might have suggested the person in question belonged to the criminal world dates back to the late 1730s. Starting from 1784, it was also used as an adjective meant to indicate people of "worthless character" and low social status, such as camp followers and vagabonds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Background ===<br/><br/>In the first decades of the 18th century, London stood out among other European cities for its beauty and maintenance, but it nonetheless had to deal with the utter poverty a huge portion of its inhabitants struggled with. Many people couldn't even afford a proper accommodation for the night, and would either spend the little they had gained during the day through begging and charity to pay for disreputable lodgings or find shelter in barns, haylofts and stables to avoid sleeping rough. In 1796, a survey of the streets of London recorded the existence of more than two thousand adults (mostly women) and three hundred children whose only way of living was begging; London was full of places for them to hide and this enabled them to maintain such a lifestyle for a long time, sometimes even years. Living on the streets and the necessity of surviving any way they could brought paupers and vagrants to engage themselves in a wide range of unregulated occupations, from the illegal ones such as prostitution, to temporary employments as chimney or crossing-sweepers, food sellers, shoeblacks or milkmaids.
