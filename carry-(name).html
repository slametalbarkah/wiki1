Its plot follows a young TSA officer who is blackmailed into allowing a nerve agent on board a flight during Christmas Eve.

On Christmas Eve, his pregnant girlfriend, Nora, encourages him to reapply and pursue his dream. Instead, Ethan asks his supervisor, Phil Sarkowski, to assign him to manage a baggage-scanning lane, hoping to demonstrate his merit for a promotion.<br/><br/>During his shift, Ethan receives an earbud, through which he is contacted by a ruthless mercenary, the Traveler, who orders him to let a specific carry-on case pass through the scanner, or Nora will be killed. The Traveler's accomplice, the Watcher, remotely monitors Ethan, thwarting his attempts to alert the authorities. Ethan secretly warns his colleague, Lionel, using a message written in invisible ink.
