<h1>Abaz Çelkupa</h1>
            
            Abaz Dilaver Çelkupa or Abaz Efendi Çelkupa (Durrës 1850–1926 Durrës) was an Albanian politician and one of the delegates and signatories of the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912. He was among the key activists of the Albanian National Awakening.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life and Ottoman service ===<br/><br/>Born in the city of Durrës in the Sanjak of Scutari, and educated as a youth in the city's kuttab, Çelkupa spent a number of years working within the Ottoman administration of the city and also served as the treasurer at the port's customs. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Albanian independence activist ===<br/><br/>Alongside other Albanian patriots from and working in Durrës, including Dom Nikollë Kaçorri, Neki Libohova, Sotir Veveçka, and Jahja Ballhysa, Çelkupa participated in and even helped in founding political societies concerned with pushing the usage of the Albanian language across schools in Ottoman Albania, as well as other efforts opposing the oppressive Young Turk administration and seeking to further Albanian interests. Examples of those societies being Vllaznia (founded in 1907) and Bashkimi (founded in 1909), in which Abaz held a senior key position. While he clearly advocated for the teaching of Albanian in schools, it seems as if he believed that the Albanian language should be written in the Arabic script, as writing in the Latin script would go against the iman and practices of Islam. Abaz Çelkupa also maintained relations and communications with the Albanian diaspora, particularly with the politicized diaspora in Bucharest, Romania, which had been publishing the Drita magazine series, one of the first magazines in Albanian. Çelkupa aided in organizing and supporting the various anti-Ottoman uprisings (e.g. the revolts of 1910 and 1912) that took place across central and northern Albania, such as those in Kurbin, Kruja and Mati. In August 1912, Abaz and a few other patriots met with Zef Harapi, accompanied by a few Albanian beys and 100 highlanders from Malësia, near Shënavlash to discuss the liberation of Durrës.
