<h1>Canadian honorifics</h1>
            
            Honorifics in Canada are accorded to various office holders in government—in the federal, provincial, and municipal jurisdictions—as well as judges, members of the armed forces, and religious figures. Two styles—the Right Honourable and Honourable—are considered formal, while others, such as Your Excellency, are regarded as honorific and complimentary to the formal styles.
