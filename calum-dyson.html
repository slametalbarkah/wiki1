<h1>Calum Dyson</h1>
            
            Calum William Dyson (born 19 September 1996) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker.<br/><br/>Dyson began his career at Everton and spent loan spells at Stockport County, Chester and Grimsby Town. He moved to Plymouth Argyle in June 2018, and later spent time out on loan to Stevenage. He retired in October 2019 due to injury, aged 23.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Everton ===<br/><br/>Born in Fazakerley, Dyson joined Everton at the age of six and progressed through the youth ranks. Along the way, Dyson grew up with Conor Grant and played together in Everton youth ranks. He also said about his position: "I would say my main position is a central striker but throughout the years at Everton I have played on the left, coming in at the back post. In my youth team days I have played on the right, so anywhere across the front three really. I have learnt all three roles and wherever the gaffer puts me in the team I will give 100 per cent." In May 2014, he helped the side win the Under-18 Premier League title in the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Dyson turned professional when he signed a two–year contract.
