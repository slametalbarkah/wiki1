            Aldi Novel Adilang is an Indonesian fisherman who was stranded alone in the Pacific Ocean for 49 days in 2018.<br/><br/>Adilang survived by crafting his own spear and fishing pole, and filtering seawater. He was rescued by a commercial tanker from Panama.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Aldi Adilang was born in Indonesia. and lived on Sulawesi. At age 16, he started working as a lamp keeper on a floating fish trap moored to the seabed 125 km out from the coast of North Sulawesi. During this time, he was stranded at sea for two short periods, "The first [time], I was afloat for a week and helped by the owner of the raft. The second time, I was afloat for two days and also received help from the owner of the raft." <br/><br/>On July 14, 2018,  the rope securing the fish trap snapped, sending Adilang drifting into the Pacific Ocean. At the beginning, he had a month's worth of food and supplies. Once Adiliang's supplies ran out, he caught fish and cooked them, making a fire out of wood from his fish trap.
