            Avenue were an English boy band. They participated in the third series of The X Factor in 2006 and initially made it to the top 12, but were banned from participation for having been specifically formed for the competition and having professional representation. They continued to proclaim their innocence.<br/><br/>After leaving The X Factor, they stayed together and had brief success with the single "Last Goodbye", which reached the UK top 50 and topped the Scottish Singles Chart. After the split, Max George went on to become a member of the British-Irish boyband The Wanted, releasing a number of top 5 hits, two official UK number ones, and three top 10 albums. Jamie Tinkler left to form the indie band Baxter, and his replacement in Avenue, Andy Brown, went on to be the lead singer of Lawson, who have released five top 10 singles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2005–06: Beginnings ===<br/><br/>Max George was born in 1988 grew up with his family in Manchester Before music, he had been a football player with Preston North End and on the verge of signing a two-year deal with them.
