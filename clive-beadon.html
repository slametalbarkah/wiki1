            Wing Commander Clive Vernon Beadon  (15 April 1919 – 14 September 1996) was a British dowser, diplomat, and officer in the Royal Air Force.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Clive Vernon Beadon was born on 15 April 1919 in Coonoor, British India, the son of a British soldier.<br/><br/>Beadon graduated from the Imperial Service College and was offered a scholarship to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Against his father's wishes, he declined acceptance to Sandhurst, instead choosing to train as a pilot at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell. He was commissioned into the Royal Air Force a few months before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, serving first in the No. 502 Squadron RAF. At the end of 1940 he was transferred to be an instructor at the Central Flying School. In August 1942 he was sent to the Middle East. Later that year he was transferred to Southeast Asia, where he flew Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Vickers Wellington bombers in hundreds of missions against the Japanese.<br/><br/>In 1944, Beadon flew a Liberator at low level to bomb Japanese supply trains on the Bangkok–Chiang Mai railway in Thailand. After his aircraft was hit by Japanese anti-aircraft guns that killed his gunner, he flew the burning aircraft over one thousand miles back to a British airbase in India, saving the lives of his remaining crewmen, whose parachutes had been destroyed by the fire.
