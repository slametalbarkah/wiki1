            Cassell is a British book publishing house founded in 1848 by John Cassell (1817–1865), which became in the 1890s an international publishing group company.<br/><br/>In 1995, Cassell plc acquired Pinter Publishers. In December 1998, Cassell plc was bought by the Orion Publishing Group. In January 2002, Cassell imprints, including the Cassell Reference and Cassell Military, were joined with the Weidenfeld imprints to form a new division under the name of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Ltd. Cassell Illustrated survives as an imprint of the Octopus Publishing Group.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>John Cassell (1817–1865), who was in turn a carpenter, temperance preacher, tea and coffee merchant, finally turned to publishing. His first publication was on 1 July 1848, a weekly newspaper called The Standard of Freedom, advocating religious, political, and commercial freedom. The Working Man's Friend became another popular publication. In 1849 Cassell was dividing his time between his publishing and his grocery business. In 1851, his expanding interests led to his renting part of La Belle Sauvage, a London inn that had been a playhouse in Elizabethan times.
