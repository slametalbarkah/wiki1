            Allison is a Mexican rock band from Mexico City, Mexico, that formed in 2002. They were nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards in 2013.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Allison was started by Erik "Erik" Canales and Manuel "Manolin" Avila in 2002. They had known each other in high school for reasons other than music and had individual musical projects before founding Allison, but none were successful. They decided to create Allison along with two former members of a band Canales was in. Canales said he suggested the name after reading a poem about the true meaning of love: "Allison is the girl you're falling in love with and she with you, but still you don't know her."<br/><br/>The band began to perform in their own town and quickly began to gain fans. As their popularity grew, the band travelled more, which led band members to drop out of high school to focus on their music career.<br/><br/>In 2003 they met Paco Zepeda, who would become their manager, and started working on demos and songs to present to some transnational labels. Zepeda presented the project to the executives of Sony/BMG and the record label decided to sign them. From December 2005 to mid-February 2006, Allison's debut album was recorded.
