<h1>Aleksandar Mirković</h1>
            
            Aleksandar Mirković (Serbian Cyrillic: Александар Мирковић; born 12 July 1988) is a politician in Serbia. He has led the Serbian Progressive Party group in the Assembly of the City of Belgrade since 2018 and was elected to the National Assembly of Serbia in the 2020 parliamentary election.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and career ==<br/><br/>Mirković was born and raised in the Belgrade municipality of Voždovac. He has a bachelor's degree in economics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Political career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Municipal politician ===<br/><br/>Mirković was deputy leader of the Progressive Party's municipal board in Belgrade from 2010 to 2013. He received the twenty-sixth position on the party's electoral list in the 2012 Belgrade City Assembly election and was elected when the list won thirty-seven mandates. The election was won by the Democratic Party and its allies, and Mirković served as a member of the opposition. The Democratic-led administration lost its majority in late 2013 and a new city election was called for 2014. Mirković was not a candidate in this election; he instead received the fourteenth position on the Progressive Party's list in the December 2013 Voždovac municipal election and was elected when the list won a majority victory with thirty-six out of fifty-five mandates. The municipal assembly met in January 2014, and Mirković was selected as its president (i.e., speaker).
