<h1>Bill Overmyer</h1>
            
            William Lee Overmyer (born June 16, 1949) is an American former professional football linebacker.<br/><br/>Overmyer played college football as a defensive end at Ashland College, where he was named the school's "best defensive lineman" in 1969, 1970 and 1971.  In 1971 he also earned an honorable mention in the Associated Press All-America team and he was a second-team of the Kodak College All-America Football Team.  He was inducted into Ashland's hall of fame in 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overmyer was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 14th round of the 1972 NFL draft with the 352nd overall pick.  In the preseason he competed with three others – fellow rookie Will Foster and veterans Ike Kelley and Bill Cody – to replace Tim Rossovich, who was holding out and was eventually traded, to be the Eagles' middle linebacker after Steve Zabel was injured in training camp.  Overmyer said of the experience:I have never played linebacker before so making the adjustments is hard. I am doing okay against the pass with out zone coverage but I'm having trouble picking up the keys...When those experienced linemen come at you a rookie is in trouble. Also, I don't get as much work as I require since we have so many linebackers here. One thing, the coaches keep talking to me so I know I have a chance...I understand that they are teaching me on defense but experience is the major difference; however, the other rookies who have played linebacker are having trouble adjusting too.
